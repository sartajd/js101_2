Task 1
Write a function named ‘countBs’ that takes a string as it’s only argument and returns number of uppercase ‘B’ characters in that string. 

Task 2
Write a function called ‘countChar’ that behaves like ‘countBs’, except it takes two arguments: a string and a letter that is to be counted in the string. 
Next, rewrite ‘countBs’ to make use of this new function
